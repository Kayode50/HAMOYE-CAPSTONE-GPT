Predicting School Completion Rates in Developing Countries


This paper will explore the use of AI in predicting school completion rates in developing countrie

The study employs machine learning
techniques such as regression analysis, and random
forests with exceptional accuracies in rand forest
algorithms to develop predictive models. The results
show that GDP per capita, region, access to electricity,
and happiness rank are the most significant factors
affecting school completion rates in developing
